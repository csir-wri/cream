          WP2 will assess trends in historical climate and downscaled CC scenarios from multiple
          regional climate models (RCMs) driven by multiple global climate models (GCMs) for use in
          impact analysis (WP3-4). The poor data of the case study basins will be supplemented with
          global satellite climate products. WP2 will evaluate and compare performances of multiple
          satellite climate products (e.g. TRMM) in reproducing the climate of the basins,
          especially precipitation. Multiple climate scenarios from the most recent IPCC scenarios
          will be analyzed to determine projected changes in climate over the basins. A multi-model
          ensemble approach will be used in the scenario analysis to allow for quantification of
          uncertainties in projections. Bias corrections will be performed prior to use of scenario
          data in WP3 and WP4. A PhD student will support WP2.

          WP3 will involve LUCC modelling in the basins, driving multiple hydrological (e.g. SWAT)
          and groundwater (e.g. MODFLOW) models with downscaled climate data (WP2) to assess the
          impacts of CC, LUCC and other future development scenarios on water quantity, quality and
          sediment yield in the basins. WP3 will also involve mapping of water-related ecosystems in
          the basins and conduct economic valuation of the benefits provided by those ecosystems for
          integration into the innovative framework to be developed in WP4. In addition,
          hydro-meteorological monitoring networks will be established in the two basins to collect
          data to supplement existing data. Two PhD students will support WP3.

          Dynamically changing hydrology under CC makes it difficult for policy makers, managers and
          stakeholders to obtain information on water resources that will reliably inform decisions
          and consensus on water investment needs. WP4 will develop a decision support framework
          that couples a system modelling tool (e.g. WEAP) to an optimization algorithm and with
          inputs from WP2-4 generate optimal trade-offs between different uses of water resources in
          the basins to inform stakeholder-based WRM decision-making. Benefit functions (BFs)
          relating water flows/storages to levels of ecosystem benefits and performance metrics
          describing the benefits will be established and included in the system modelling,
          optimization and trade-offs analysis. A PhD student will support WP4.

          WP5 will analyze the governance of WRM and CC adaptation in the basins and the dynamics of
          decision making on WRM. A scoping study will review political, economic and social aspects
          of water governance and the history of institutions to construct a picture of applicable
          socio-cultural and political norms. Key constraints of WRM in the basins will be
          identified and analyzed in depth, incorporating political and social dynamics at basin and
          national levels. WP5 will also identify the ‘room for maneuver’ to more effectively
          introduce innovation to policy and decision making for climate-resilient basins.

          WP6 is dedicated to building capacities of researchers and stakeholders. The capacity of
          Ghanaian researchers will be enhanced by the Danish researchers through short training
          courses and joint working sessions to be alternated between Ghana and Denmark. The project
          will produce 4 PhDs to be enrolled in Ghanaian universities and co-supervised by project
          partners. The PhD students will spend about 3 months per year in Denmark, working with the
          Danish partners. Additionally, the project stakeholders will be trained in the use of
          tools and data from the project. The project outputs will be disseminated jointly via
          publications in peer reviewed scientific journals, policy briefs and conferences.
